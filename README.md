## Welcome to [MarkDown]!
## Come to start...
### About of design text...

* to add a heading to the text, you must put the "#" sign. 

* to italicize text, you need to frame it with "*". *For example*

* to make the text bold, you need to frame it with "**". **For example**

* to make the text crossed out, you need to frame it with the sign "~~". ~~For exaple~~

to add unordered lists, you need to highlight the items by (*). For example:
* Element 1
* Element 2
* ...

to add numbered lists, you need to number the items. For example:
1. Element 1
2. Element 2

* To insert a picture, sound or another objects you need to write a structure - ! [] () (without spaces)

## Works with a repository

1. **git init** - initializing empty repozitory

2. **git status** - show untracked files

3. ### *_git add_* - add file version
* * * [!TIP]: **git add .** - add version to all files
* * * *        AND **git add --all

4. **git commit** - save changes

5. **git commit -m "message"** - allow us to avoid git console and type message incide terminal

~~this was supposed to be my ad~~

6. **git commit -am "message"** - the same as flag -m allow us avoid git add

7. **git log** - get story of commits

8. **git checkout** - allow us switch commits

9. **git checkout master** - get back to main tree

10. **git diff** - show differences between current state and last commit
